# Problem
   We want to simulate a simple population. This population consists of cellular automats, with each
   cell having two states: alive or dead. Every cell has 8 neighbors (Moore-Neighborhood). The state of
   the cell depends on itâ€™s current state and the number of living and dead neighbors. The goal is, to
   simulate the evoluion of an initial population. The subsequent generation is a result of the prior one.
   Hence, care for not mixing the states between the generations. Develop a software, which models
   the evolution of the population and visualizes the result as a grid with colored squares.



# Evolution rules
   Adjust the rule set from homework 2 to the following rules:
   I. Dead cell
   a. Cell reincarnates if it has got exacly 3 living neighbors
   b. Else it stays dead
   II. Living cell
   a. Cell stays alive if it has got exacly 2, 4 or 5 living neighbors
   b. In all other cases the cell dies

## I have used processing 3D for visualize this.
